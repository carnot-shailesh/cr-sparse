Blocks Signal in Haar Basis
=============================

.. contents::
    :depth: 2
    :local:

A Blocks signal as proposed by Donoho et al.
in Wavelab :cite:`buckheit1995wavelab` is
a concatenation of blocks with different heights.
It has a sparse representation in a Haar basis.

In this test problem with the structure
:math:`\bb = \bA \bx`, the signal
:math:`\bb` is the blocks signal
(of length 1024), :math:`\bA`
is a Haar basis with
5 levels of decomposition and :math:`\bx`
is the sparse representation of the signal
in this basis.
This basis is real, complete and orthonormal.
Hence, a simple solution for getting
:math:`\bx` from :math:`\bb` is the formula:

.. math::

    \bx = \bA^T \bb.

This test problem is useful in identifying
basic mistakes in a sparse recovery algorithm.
This problem should be very easy to solve by
any sparse recovery algorithm. However, there
is a caveat. If a sparse recovery algorithm
depends on the expected sparsity of the
signal (typically a parameter K in greedy algorithms),
the reconstruction would fail if K is specified below
the actual number of significant components of :math:`\bx`.
