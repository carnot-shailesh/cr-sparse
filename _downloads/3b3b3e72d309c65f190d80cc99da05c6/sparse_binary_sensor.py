Sparse Binary Sensing Matrices
===============================================

A (random) sparse binary sensing matrix has a very simple design.
Assume that the signal space is :math:`\RR^N` and the measurement
space is :math:`\RR^M`.
Every column of a sparse binary sensing matrix has a 1 in
exactly :math:`d` positions and 0s elsewhere. The indices
at which ones are present are randomly selected for each column.

Following is an example sparse binary matrix with 3 ones in
each column

.. math::

    \\begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\\\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\
    0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\
    0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1\\\\
    1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\\\
    1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\\\
    0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1\\\\
    0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\
    \\end{bmatrix}

From the perspective of algorithm design, we often require that
the sensing matrix have unit form columns. This can be easily
attained for sparse binary matrices by scaling them with
:math:`\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}`.


JAX provides an efficient way of storing sparse matrices in BCOO
format. By default we employ this storage format for the (random) sparse
binary matrices.
