This section includes several tools which 
form basic building blocks for other higher level
solvers.

We provide generators for:

* Indicator functions
* Projector function
* Proximal operators for functions which are prox capable
* Smooth functions for which gradients can be computed

Most of the descriptions focus on convex sets
:math:`C \subset \RR^n` and convex functions 
with signatures  :math:`\RR^n \to \RR`. However,
the implementations generalize well for the 
complex vector space :math:`\CC^n` with the
real inner product :math:`\langle x, y \rangle = \Re(x^H y)`.


Also, while we describe the math for vectors 
:math:`x \in \RR^n`, the memory layout of these
vectors could be in the form of multi-dimensional arrays too.

Indicator Function Generators
------------------------------

Let :math:`C` be a subset of :math:`\RR^n`. An indicator function 
:math:`I_C(x)` is defined as :math:`I_C(x) = 0` for every :math:`x \in C`.
For our purposes, its extended-value extension is relevant which
is defined as:

.. math::

  I_C(x) = \begin{cases} 
    0 & \text{if } x \in C \\
    \infty       & x \notin C
  \end{cases}

An *indicator function generator* creates an indicator function based
on the specification of the set :math:`C`. For example if :math:`C`
is a Euclidean ball, then the specification of :math:`C` is based on
its center and radius.

Projection Function Generators
---------------------------------

A key idea in covex optimization is Projection on Convex Sets
(POCS). Given a convex set :math:`C \subset \RR^n` 
and a point :math:`x \in \RR^n`, the projection on to convex 
set :math:`C` is defined as :

.. math::

    P_C(x) =  \text{arg} \min_{v \in C} \| x - v \|_2.

i.e. find the point :math:`v` in :math:`C` which is 
closest to :math:`x`.  If :math:`x` is inside :math:`C`,
then the projection is :math:`x` itself. 

In general, computation of the projection for arbitrary
convex sets can be very hard. However, for specific 
classes of convex sets, the projection can be computed
efficiently. Here we provide projection function generators for
some classes of convex sets.

on the specification of the set :math:`C`.

.. _api:opt:smooth:


Smooth Function Generators
----------------------------------

The *smoothness* of a function is a property measured by the
number of continuous derivatives it has over some domain.

We are concerned with convex functions :math:`f : \RR^n \to \RR`
defined over convex sets :math:`C \in \RR^n`
and consider them to be smooth if the gradient :math:`g = \nabla f : \RR^n \to \RR^n`
exists over the interior of its domain. 

For a smooth convex function :math:`f`, we need to be able to

* Compute the value :math:`f(x)` at :math:`x \in \RR^n` using the extended-value extension
  (i.e. :math:`f(x) = \infty \text{if} x \notin C`.
* Compute the gradient :math:`g = \nabla f` at :math:`x`, :math:`g(x)`
* Compute the pair :math:`g(x), f(x)`  at :math:`x`

While JAX provides automatic gradient computation capability, it doesn't 
match exactly at the boundaries of the domain :math:`C` of :math:`f` for many of 
our functions of interest. Hence, we choose to provide our hand-coded 
gradient implementations.

Sometimes, the gradient computation :math:`g(x)`
and function computation :math:`f(x)` have common parts, 
and this can be exploited in improving the algorithm efficiency. 
Hence, we provide an ability to compute the pair too if an
algorithm desires to compute them together efficiently.

We represent smooth functions by the type :py:class:`cr.sparse.opt.SmoothFunction`.

    SmoothFunction

Let `op` be a variable of type :py:class:`cr.sparse.opt.SmoothFunction` 
which represents some smooth function :math:`f`. Then:

* `op.func(x)` returns the function value :math:`f(x)`.
* `op.grad(x)` returns the gradient of function :math:`g(x) = \nabla f(x)`.
* `op.grad_val(x)` returns the pair :math:`(g(x), f(x))`.

A *smooth function generator* creates 
an instance of :py:class:`cr.sparse.opt.SmoothFunction` based
on the specification of the smooth function :math:`f`.

We provide tools to build your own smooth functions. 

- You can provide just the definition of the smooth function and 
  we will use JAX to compute the gradient.
- You can provide definitions of the function :math:`f(x)` and the gradient :math:`g(x)`.
- You can provide definitions of :math:`f(x)`, :math:`g(x)` as well as an 
  efficient routine to compute the pair: :math:`(g(x), f(x))`.

.. _api:opt:proximal:

Proximal Operator Generators
----------------------------------

The *proximal operator* for a function :math:`f` is defined as

.. math::

    p_f(x, t) = \text{arg} \min_{z \in \RR^n} f(x) + \frac{1}{2t} \| z - x \|_2^2

The proximal operator :math:`p` is a mapping from :math:`(\RR^n, \RR) \to \RR^n`
which maps a vector :math:`x`  to its proximal vector :math:`z = p_f(x,t)`
where :math:`t` can be thought of as a step size for computing the proximal vector.

The proximal operator can be thought of as a generalization of the projection operator. 
If :math:`f` is an indicator function for some convex set :math:`C`, then
the proximal operator is nothing but the projection function onto the set :math:`C`.
If we think of :math:`f` as a cost function over :math:`\RR^n` then indicator 
functions are possibly the toughest cost functions.

For smooth functions, the proximal operator reduces to the gradient step.

We informally call a function as *prox-capable* if its proximal operator 
can be computed efficiently.

For a prox-capable function :math:`f`, in typical proximal algorithms, we need to be able to

* Compute the value :math:`f(x)` at :math:`x \in \RR^n` using the extended-value extension
* Compute the proximal vector for the step size :math:`t` as :math:`p_f(x, t)`
* Compute the pair :math:`p_f(x, t), f(p_f(x, t))`

Note that in the last case, we first compute
:math:`z = p_f(x, t)` and then compute the value :math:`v  = f(z)`.


We represent *prox-capable* functions by the type :py:class:`cr.sparse.opt.ProxCapable`.

    ProxCapable

Let `op` be a variable of type :py:class:`cr.sparse.opt.ProxCapable` 
which represents some prox-capable function :math:`f`. Then:

* `op.func(x)` returns the function value :math:`f(x)`.
* `op.prox_op(x)` returns the proximal vector for a step size: :math:`z = p_f(x, t)`.
* `op.prox_vec_val(x)` returns the pair :math:`z,v = p_f(x, t), f(z)`.

A *proximal operator generator* creates 
an instance of :py:class:`cr.sparse.opt.ProxCapable` based
on the specification of the prox-capable function :math:`f`.

Available proximal operator generators:

.. autosummary::
  :toctree: _autosummary

  prox_zero
  prox_l1

You can build your own :py:class:`cr.sparse.opt.ProxCapable` wrappers
by providing the definition of the function :math:`f(x)` and its 
proximal operator :math:`p_f(x, t)`.
