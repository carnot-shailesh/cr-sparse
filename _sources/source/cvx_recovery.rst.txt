Truncated Newton Interior Points Method (TNIPM)
---------------------------------------------------------

This method can be used to solve problems of type:

.. math::

  \min \| A x  - b \|_2^2 + \lambda \| x \|_1 

The method works as follows:

* The :math:`\ell_1` regularized LSP (Least Squares Program) above is 
  transformed into a convex quadratic program with linear inequality constraints.
* The logarithmic barrier for the quadratic program is constructed.
* The central path for this logarithmic barrier minimizer is identified.
* Truncated newton method is used to solve for points on the central path.

  * Compute the search direction as an approximate solution to the Newton system
  * Compute the step size by backtracking line search
  * Update the iterate
  * Construct a dual feasible point 
  * Evaluate the duality gap
  * Repeat till the relative duality gap is within a specified threshold

* The Newton system is solved approximately using preconditioned conjugate gradients.

The ``solve_from`` versions below are useful if the solution is known partially.
The ``solve`` versions are more directly applicable when solution is not known.
Both ``solve_from`` and ``solve`` are available as regular and JIT-compiled 
versions.

Alternating Directions Methods
-------------------------------------

This is based on :cite:`yang2011alternating`.

A tutorial has been provided to explore these 
methods in action. 
The ``yall1.solve`` method is an overall wrapper method 
for solving different types of :math:`\ell_1` minimization
problems. It in turn calls the lower level methods for solving
specific types of problems.

Spectral Projected Gradient L1 (SPGL1)
------------------------------------------

Berg and Friedlander proposed the spectral
projected gradient l1 (SPGL1) algorithm
in :cite:`BergFriedlander:2008`.
They provide a MATLAB package implementing
the algorithm in :cite:`spgl1site`.
A NumPy based Python port is also available
`here <https://pypi.org/project/spgl1/>`_.
We have implemented the algorithm with JAX.
